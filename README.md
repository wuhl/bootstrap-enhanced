# Bootstrap::Enhanced

TODO: Write a gem description

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'bootstrap-enhanced'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bootstrap-enhanced

## Usage

After you install bootstrap-enhanced and add it to your Gemfile, you need to run the generator:

```console
rails generate bootstrapenhanced:install
```

The generator will generate the bootstrap:install command, prepare the application html file for using bootstrap, adjust the menu place inside the stylesheet for bootstrap, create a menu file inside views and create some bootstrap specific language files.

To run properly, gem rails-i18n-enhanced has to be installed first.
